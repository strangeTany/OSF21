What kind of strategy we use depends on conditions for which we could use following steps:

1) Check if it's possible to decide on whether it is safe to grant a resource, if it is, use avoidance.
2) Check for ways to preempt resources, if we can, than our choice is recovery through preemtion.
3) Try to set checkpoints of any kind, that would allow to use recovery through rollback.
4) Check if it is safe to kill a process, if so, use recovery through killing process.
5) And the last resort one wouldn't like to use unless nothing else is possible, would be prevention strategy.
